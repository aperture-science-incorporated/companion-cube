      New Relic requires a README file in all projects. This README should
      give a general overview of the project, and should point to additional resources
      (security, contributing, etc.) where developers and users can learn further

      New Relic has moved the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file to a [centralized location](https://github.com/newrelic/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
      where it is referenced automatically by every repository in the New Relic organization. Because of this change, any other `CODE_OF_CONDUCT` file
      in a repository is now redundant and should be removed

      A [`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`](https://github.com/newrelic/opensource-website/blob/develop/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
      file can be present in your repository to grant attribution to all dependencies
      being used by this project. This document is necessary if you are using
      third-party source code in your project, with the exception of code referenced outside
      the project's compiled/bundled binary (ex. some Java projects require modules to
      be pre-installed in the classpath, outside the project binary and therefore
      outside the scope of the `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`). Please
      review your project's dependencies and create a THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md file if
      necessary. For JavaScript projects, you can generate this file using the
      [oss-cli](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-oss-cli)
